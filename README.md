CppEdgeDetection
======================

Faint edge detection with edge score based on rectagle binary partition of the images.
Rectangle implementation of the CVPR 2016 paper "Fast Detection of Curved Edges at Low SNR":
https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Ofir_Fast_Detection_of_CVPR_2016_paper.html

This solution is for visual studio with opencv.
It is faster than its Matlab equivilent projects:
1) Rectangles: https://github.com/NatiOfir/FaintCurvedEdgeDetection
2) Triangles: https://github.com/NatiOfir/TrianglesEdgeDetection

Good luck!
